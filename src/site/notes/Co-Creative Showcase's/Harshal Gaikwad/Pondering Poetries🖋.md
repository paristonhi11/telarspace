# The Sun’s going to set…

A day long is our life  
Innocent and happy we were  
Just like the fresh morning  
Only joy was all in the air

Life is in every little thing  
We forget as we grow old  
As the day gets hot n tiring  
Peace slips from our hold

Shadow hide under our feet  
The race of success start at noon  
We focus as if we’re on diet  
Sipping joy with tiny little spoon

We hustle, we fight for our dreams  
Definition to happiness is bend  
Sad if fail, succeed then happy  
The day begins to descend

Whether the dreams come true  
The happiness don’t last forever  
We learn what matters in life  
Is life itself, we get back never

We seek to relive the childhood  
Life in little things, joy we believed  
Now the Sun’s already down  
We remember the life we lived

Sky will glow in thousand colors  
Thankful we’ll be as we wait  
Gradually the light will fade  
And slowly the sun’s going to set !
